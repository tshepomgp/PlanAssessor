NOTE This height would normally be taken at level 2, but if the sum of the plan areas of ribs A, B, C, D, E, F
and G is greater than 30 % of the total area of the room, the ceiling height should be measured to level 1.

Figure 3 ― Interpretation of minimum floor to ceiling height (see 4.3.2)

4.4 Floor area
The overall plan area of any dwelling house shall be not less than
a) 15 m2 in the case of a temporary building,
b) 27 m2 in the case of permanent category 1 buildings, or
c) 30 m2 in the case of any other permanent building.
NOTE With the present tendency towards smaller sites it is likely that many more houses of a size much
smaller than has been common in the past will be built. In considering the very small permanent building it
should be remembered that size cannot be equated to quality and a small house will not therefore
automatically detract from the value of surrounding larger houses.

Edition 3.1

Annex A
Deleted by amendment No. 1.

Annex B
(informative)

Commentary on this part of SANS 10400
The plan areas given are very small but this is necessary in the interests of providing affordable
housing. In the case of certain types of self-help housing, such as the “core house”, the first stage
will, by definition, be small and will seldom consist of more than a single room plus toilet facilities.
The fact that such a building would be regarded as a temporary building should ensure that it will
eventually progress to something more reasonable in size.
Since a minimum size for habitable rooms is specified in 4.2.3, the number of rooms in a dwelling
house will, to some extent, influence the overall area of the building. In this context, the deemed-tosatisfy requirements do not indicate whether a habitable room should be of greater size than the
minimum given if such a room is to be used for multiple purposes. For practical, if not legal, reasons
this would obviously be desirable. In the case of a temporary house that consists of one habitable
room it is assumed that this will be used for eating, sleeping and cooking, as well as being a general
living room.

Annex C
Deleted by amendment No. 1.
